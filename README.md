# prediction-of-cardiac-arrest-using-machine-learning-algorithms.
In the world today, cardiovascular diseases are the most common problem in the majority of people. There is a various problem that causes cardiac arrest such as people not concerned about there health, irregular eating habits, stress, laziness and eating preserved food. The heart is an organ that utilizes fatty acid for energy even in a well-fed state. All other organs in the body utilize glucose in a fed state. so when we have irregular food habits, it will increase the blood sugar level and cholesterol level, which leads to cardiac arrest . In this study, the raw dataset is collected of the patients who visited the hospital with heart-related issues that concerned with cardiac arrest. We perform the data preprocessing and cleaning for the dataset to balance the dataset, and then we applied several classifiers for model training. additionally, we used the pickling method to store our data in a separate file so the files can be easily accessible for the patients. This project aims to study different machine learning algorithms on a dataset to predict the possibility of cardiac arrest based on various controlled and uncontrolled variables.
